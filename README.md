# AITherapy

### AITherapy is a chatbot empowered by LLM and aims to support people with therapeutic talk, anywhere, any time.

1. 16133 counseling dialogs are collected and cleaned for fine-tuning open-source LLM (Large Language Models).
2. Google Flan-T5-Base was chosen to be the base model. The detailed information about flan-t5 model can be referred to here: <https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-base>
3. Lora was employed for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.


Here are comparisons of test samples on the original flan-t5-base model and the fine-tuned model.
